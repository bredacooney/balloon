        <h3>Manufacturing</h3>

        <p>Our manufacturing division is staffed by a team of certified balloon engineers with combined balloon
          experience of
          more than 50 years.</p>

        <p>We make all kinds of balloons, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Party balloons</li>
          <li>Helium-filled balloons</li>
          <li>Hot-air balloons.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Repair</h3>

        <p>We repair all forms of balloon damage including holes, tears and lack of air. So don't throw out that old
          balloon,
          bring it to us and let it live to see another day!</p>

        <h3>Restoration</h3>

        <p>Do you have a balloon that has seen better days? Using state of the art balloon technology, we can restore
          your
          once-loved balloon to all it's former glory.</p>

        <h3>Customisation</h3> <!--error started h3, ended with h4, still appears ok-->

        <P>Want to stand out from the crowd? Provide us with a design and we will apply it to whatever type of balloon
          you are
          purchasing.</p>

        <p>If you are not the creative type, our team of designers can create a unique design for you that reflects your
          personality.</p>

        <p>How the customisation process works:
        <ol>
          <li>You choose or create a design. </li>
          <li>You choose the balloon(s) you want. </li>
          <li>We make the balloons for you.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
